                <p>RetroArch/Libretro is a big project that consumes a lot of our resources and time. An impressive amount of spinoff products and derivatives (the vast majority not even affiliated with our project) all depend on its continuing development and online services.</p>
                <p>To keep the show ongoing, there are various ways you can support the project.</p>

     <p>We use funds from our Patreon on a periodic basis for the purpose of funding and creating new bounties. Bounties help the project accomplish its goals and to fix issues, both existing and new ones.</p>
     <p>If you would like to directly fund a bounty, you can create your own bounty by going to the libretro Github repository first, and then typing in the name of the repository inside Bountysource and specifying the amount of money you want to pledge.</p>
     <p>If you would like to contribute to our bounty funds directly (to leave it at our discretion how we will appropriate it for the bounty system), you can do so by clicking on the Bountysource logo above.</p>
