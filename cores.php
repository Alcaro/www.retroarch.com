                <h2>Online updating/downloading of cores</h2>
                <p>On most platforms (except game consoles and certain mobile platforms), RetroArch comes with dynamic module loading support.</p>
                <p>On these systems, you will be able to install and/or update new cores as they become available on our buildbot.</p>
                <p>To access these, go to RetroArch's main menu, select 'Online Updater', and then select 'Update Cores'.</p>
                <p>You don't need to download a new version of RetroArch in order to be able to run new or updated cores!</p>

                <h2>Audio Settings</h2>
                <p>In Audio Settings, you can adjust the audio volume and choose which audio device RetroArch will output to. This is useful if you plug an HDMI screen to your laptop.</p>
                <p>Advanced users can tweak the audio synchronization. Audio sync is very important in RetroArch because the games speed is computed based on the audio code.</p>
                <p>You can also choose a DSP plugin to add effects like <b>echo</b> or <b>reverb</b> to the game audio.</p>

                <h2>Input Settings</h2>
                <p>This is the place to configure your mouse, keyboard and/or joypads. You can choose between <a href="index.php?page=joypad-autoconfig">Joypad autoconfiguration</a> or manual binding.</p>
                <p>You can bind actions like <b>Fast forward</b> or <b>Save state</b> to keyboard keys and joypad buttons. A good idea is to map these actions on the joypad while setting one of the button to the <b>Hotkey function</b>. This way, pressing Hotkey plus a button will perform an action, but you will still be able to use this button in the game.</p>

                <h2>Playlists Settings</h2>
                <p>In this section, you can attribute a default core to a playlist.</p>
                <p>This is useful for per-system playlists when you already know what emulator you want to use to launch the games of a given playlist.</p>
                <p>If you don't set any default core, RetroArch will ask you which core you want to use on a playlist entry basis.</p>
